# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a part of the [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum on programming. It is  a practical [task](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) on basic JavaScript DOM manipulation concepts. 

This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. It contains a grid whose size is adjusted by the user with a popup message when the game starts. The grid is responsive to mouse motions using a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when the user's mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through the grid like a pen would. As an extra score a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10% is implemented.
